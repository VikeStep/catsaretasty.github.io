title: Tastycat's "well, why not?" event!
---
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, or good...whatever else it could possibly be! It certainly has been a while since we have had a good chat, yes? We hope that you have enjoyed your summer and are now ready to jump back into the groove with us here at TastycatHQ. If you have missed our latest event, here is a brief summary of what went on:

We started as we always do on a Friday evening with Monstercat Podcast 70, but tonight that was merely an opening act for what was to follow, as we were incredibly lucky to have the likes of Rob Gasser, Richard Caddock and Protostar join us alongside over 500 users in the community. Our users took full advantage of being able to ask as many questions as they wanted to about their releases, tricks of the trade or just plain old #TOPBANTS.

So with a room filled with great people and a great atmosphere, our friend Rob Gasser stepped up and tickled us with released both old and new. GET MAD and his mix of Fox Stevenson's Throwdown being just some of many tracks squeezed into a hot mix that locked on to all our senses (yes, you could even taste it). He was also kind enough to include his latest track by the name of “Fever” which has been offered up as a [free download](https://soundcloud.com/robgassermusic/fever).

As word spread of our event, we were joined by several other artists who wished to jump in and chat to the community.

Which, despite the slight drop in user numbers, still resulted in the chat moving a mile a second. A lot of fun was had!

Riding the energy generated by Rob's mix, we were next graced with the presence of Richard Caddock who took us time travelling with the most futuristic of bass combined with sprinkles of progressive house. Generdyn's Funky Chinese Kitty was the first tune to take our hands and lead us down a road less travelled. Of course we passed familiar landmarks placed by the likes of Galantis and Jack Ü, but for the most part this mix brought some of the more “unappreciated” artists to the fold such as Vindata (with Spirals) and Lido (with I Love You). Of course from here we could talk about the impact this set had on us, but it is far easier when one of our users does that for us:

BatmanMC said "thank you Richard for showing us all some good future bass for once. haven't heard too much of it in a while aside from High Tide, Glow, and all the Hyper Potions tracks"

But then...Protostar barged his way into the spotlight.

“@Protostar Holy shit, you're here. CANNOT express how much love I have for your style, it's so astonishingly intricate. And the those guitars holy shit"

Also Snacks8 was talking about “raving and some dude in a icecream suite is dancing next to you"which was very interesting to of course, but that is a story for another day...Anyway, PROTOSTAR.

Despite having visited us in the past, we don't believe anyone could have been prepared for the amount of questions thrown about, “The hype is real” being something of an understatement from one of our users. Amazingly, Protostar managed to take this all in his stride and answered what he could whilst still cracking some smart one-liners.

From here, it seems our collective consciousness was placed into an industrial blender, as the remaining notes from this event consist mainly of “this is siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick” (no, really, this is how we take notes). In fairness, how are we supposed to handle what was an absolutely jaw-dropping set containing the likes of Draper's “Pressure”, Varien's “Aether and Light” and “1984” by Teknian. Despite our best efforts to try and accurate record just how intense this mix was, our words really do not do Protostar justice – his transitions absolutely INSANE, especially from “Genesis” into his latest collaboration with donger-buddy Draper: “Chrysalis”. But wait! As with all the greatest deals...there was more! We were even given a sneak-peak at his latest adventure with Mandorli in the form of the track “Ruxxa”. We will absolutely be listening out for this further down the line.

So, there we have it: our little event grew into something great – as they always do! Thank you to everyone involved for their patience, generosity and of course their talent! Please consider following/supporting the guys in whatever way you can:
